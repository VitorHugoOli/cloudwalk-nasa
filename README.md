# Cloudwalk NASA challenge

Hello, this is a showcase test for the Cloudwalk NASA challenge. In this app we use flutter to
create a simple app that fetches data from the NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API and displays
it in a gallery.

The apps contains two screens, the first one is the picture of the day, and the second one is a
gallery with the last 30 days of pictures.

The app is divided into 3 sections:

1. The Home Page - This is the main page of the app. It displays the image of the day, and a list of
   the previous images.
2. The List Page - This page displays a list of the previous images. You can scroll through the
   list, and tap on an image to view it.
3. The Settings Page - This page allows you to control the audio playback of the app. You can toggle
   the audio on/off, and control the audio playback.
